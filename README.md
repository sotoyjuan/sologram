# Sologram
_Current version:_ **0.0.1**

## Getting Started

Node Version: `v18.12.1`

1. `npm install`

2. You can run it with `npm run start` or if you are using `nvm`, you can run it with `npm run start:dev` to make sure the correct node version is running.

## Notes
(A couple of things to improve)
- Missing unit tests :/
- Used one external library for double tap functionality :/
